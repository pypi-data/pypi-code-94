"""
This module contains the different Trace apis.

Note that there are a couple of different traces:
  * The ExtractionTrace and MetaExtractionTrace, which are offered to the process function.
  * ExtractionTraceBuilder, which is a trace that can be built; it does not exist in hansken yet, but it is added after
    building.
  * SearchTrace, which represents an immutable trace which is returned after searching for traces.
